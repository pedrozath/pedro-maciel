    title: Original Logo
    description: The original logo at the time (which is still the current one until
      this work was posted) was created by Romulo Castilho. It may look appealing,
      but it looks like too much a party and doesn't feel like São Paulo.

    title: Comparison to Recife
    description: Comparing to other cities, like Recife, in this example, it doesn't
      differentiates. This is a problem, as Recife is completelly different city,
      being known by its happyness and carnival events. Being at least 2500km distant
      from São Paulo, Recife is almost like in another country, having different cultural
      and social aspects. Thereby, it's almost mandatory São Paulo logo to be different.

      a great migration happens. '

    description: The city is marked through an architecture that is both courageous
      and arrogant. Where else can you find a building where at least 5000 people
      live? (Copan Building). This is also represented into the urban art of artists
      like Gemeos through out the city.

      like in the edge of world changes.
